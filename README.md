# Self Taught TypeScript

#### Note

TypeScript helps in development process before codes get compiled but not during runtime, static type check.

#### JS & TS differences

* JavaScript uses dynamic type, that is, resolving at runtime
* TypeScript uses static type, that is, type set during development

#### Type of Declarations

- `var` can be redeclared and updated (globally or function scoped)
- `let` can be updated but not redeclared (block scoped)
- `const` cannot be updated or redeclared (block scoped)
